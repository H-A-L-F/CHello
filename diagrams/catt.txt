SEQUENCE DIAGRAM

>>A system sequence diagram (SSD) is used to describe this flow of
information into and out of the automated portion of the system. Thus, an SSD
documents the inputs and the outputs and identifies the interaction between
actors and the system.

>> The opt frame is used when a message or a series of messages is optional or based on some true/false condition. The alt frame is used with if-then-else logic

>>The message name should follow the verb-noun syntax to make the purpose
clear.
